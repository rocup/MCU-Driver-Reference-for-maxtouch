# MCU-Driver-Reference-for-maxtouch and MPTT based MCU
This is a project based on SAML21. You can import the code using the ppt discription.

1.Support maxtouch HA parts with function safety (I2C read and write with sequence number and checksum).
2.Support MCU based solution with MPTT imported and if there's only touch keys, only TOUCH_KEYS can be enabled.
3.Add a object-server tool to convert .raw config file to config array data.
4.Add self test module for customers to use for test in the host machine driver.
5.Define several macros to distinguish different functions that you can use based on your requirements.
